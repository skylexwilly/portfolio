<h2>MY HOBBIES</h2>

<li>FOOTBALL</li><h1><img src="FOOTBALL.jpg" alt=""></h1>Playing football also helps me relax and have confidence when I have stress and frustration. For a moment, after doing a task or studying all day, I feel tired and exhausted. However, having fun with the ball, like kicking it against the wall or trying to do some tricks, all my fatigue and exhaustion disappear.


<li>DANCING</li><p><img src="dance.jpg" alt=""></p>Dancing provides physical/mental refreshment and relaxation. Laughter and funâ€”dancing can provide a lot of entertainment. Dancing is a form of exercise. Dancers find inspiration and motivation as they become lost in the dance.
That's because dancing, like many physical activities, releases hormones known as endorphins. These chemicals are directly responsible for making you feel happy, relaxed, and even euphoric. Dancing is also incredibly expressive, and can be a way for you to release pent-up emotions in a healthy manner.

<li>GAMING</li><h1><img src="gamingps.png" alt=""></h1>
